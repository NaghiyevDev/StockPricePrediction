***Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning***

This project demonstrates stock price prediction using machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). 
It leverages historical stock data to build a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices. 
The project is designed for educational purposes and showcases techniques in data science, machine learning, time-series forecasting, and deep learning.

***Project Overview***

This project involves predicting stock prices using machine learning algorithms, focusing on LSTM models. 
The data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library, and the project processes this data to build an LSTM model for stock price prediction.

Key Steps:

  1. Data Collection: Fetch historical stock data using yfinance.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize stock data and analyze trends.
  3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and scale the data for model training.
  4. Model Building: Train an LSTM model to predict stock prices.
  5. Evaluation: Compare predicted vs actual prices and assess model performance.


***Technologies Used***

  Python: Programming language used.
  Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
  NumPy: Numerical operations.
  Matplotlib: Visualization of stock data.
  Keras/TensorFlow: Building and training the LSTM model.
  yfinance: Fetching stock data from Yahoo Finance.


***Requirements***

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries. You can easily install them using pip by running:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

***Dependencies:***

  numpy
  pandas
  matplotlib
  yfinance
  tensorflow
  scikit-learn
  
  
You can install them manually by running:

  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance tensorflow scikit-learn


***Setup Instructions***

  1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/StockPricePrediction.git
     cd StockPricePrediction
     
  2.Install dependencies:
     If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it and install dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
            pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Download stock data: The project will automatically download stock data for a selected company (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple) from Yahoo Finance.

  4. Prepare the environment: Make sure that Python and the necessary libraries are installed.


***Usage***

1. Run the main script: The main script is stock_price_prediction.py. To run the project, use the following command:

   python stock_price_prediction.py

3. Modify the stock ticker: In the stock_price_prediction.py script, you can change the stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple) to any other stock you wish to predict.

    ticker = "AAPL"  # Replace with any stock ticker (e.g., 'GOOGL', 'MSFT')
   
5. Visualize Results: After running the script, it will download stock data, process it, train the model, and then visualize the stock's closing prices.

***Model Evaluation***

After the model is trained, the program will evaluate its performance by comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices and visualizing them.

Evaluation Metrics:
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  The script will also plot the predicted vs actual stock prices to visualize the model's performance.
